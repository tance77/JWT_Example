# Getting Starting

* Git clone https://github.com/tance77/JWT_Example.git
* cd to the newly cloned directory 
* yarn install
* sequelize db:migrate
* npm start
* From your browser navigate to localhost:3001 or 127.0.0.1:3001

After completing the above steps you should be able to play around with some of the features on the website. The information you get using the JSON Web Token is the user's information, not including their password.
